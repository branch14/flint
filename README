== Welcome to Flint ==

Flint is a Ruby On Rails based web app for applications that deal with
barcodes.

Currently it's pragmatically aimed towards a runnig media art
installation in conjunction with xmms2.

It consist of three parts:

  - a Ruby On Rails backend
  - a cron script
  - a WxRuby frontend

There is a tiny shell script that starts all three parts, with a
little delay to make sure the backend is settled, when the frontend
comes up.

  $ ./start.sh


=== I Backend ===

Requirements

  $ apt-get install xmms2 libxmmsclient-ruby libopenssl-ruby libsqlite3-ruby
  $ gem install rails

Run

  $ script/server


=== II Cron/Daemon ===

Run

  $ ruby lib/flint_cron.rb


=== III Frontend ===

Requirements

  $ sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-0
  $ gem install wxruby xml-simple

Run

  $ ruby lib/flint_fe_wxruby.rb


=== API ===

The frontend accesses the following url to submit input and recieve
the information to be displayed. E.g.:

  $ curl http://0.0.0.0:3000/options/execute_by_code/123456123456.xml
